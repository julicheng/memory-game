# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

The timer will start as soon as the page loads.

**On Each turn:**
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

When the game ends, the number of moves made, star rating and time to complete will be displayed.
